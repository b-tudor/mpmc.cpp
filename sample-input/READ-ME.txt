The tests beginning with 'pi' are tests of the path integral functionality. They are all
set up to be run with 8 PI images (8 beads), but this is a function of the input file
settings 'PI_trial_chain_length', 'bead_perturb_probability' and 'corrtime'.
PI_trial_chain_length sets the number of beads to perturb when exercising an MC move that
reconfigures the beads of the PI polymer loop relative to each other. This value is
typically 25% - 40% of the total number of beads used for the PI representation and a
suitable setting is determined by the acceptance rate for bead perturbing moves (usually
you want to set the PI_trial_chain_length such that your acceptance rate for these moves
is about 40-50%). corrtime sets the number of MC steps between sampling data stats, while
bead_perturb_probability is the percentage of these moves that will be bead perturbations.
A higher bead count will often require a higher corrtime to allow the PI polymer chain to
evolve into an uncorrelated configuration between samples. I.e. the number of accepted
bead perturbation moves, on average, should be such that, in consideration with the
PI_trial_chain_length, on average, each bead is moved once between data sampling
(corrtime).

These files will work with a higher PI bead count, but for best results the values of
PI_trial_chain_length, bead_perturb_probability and corrtime in the input files should be
set to appropriate values. 

sample-input/pi000-free-argon-2K/

	Since MPMC++ will not run with a single particle, this test simulates a free
	argon atom by simulating two argon atoms separated with enough distance that 
	they are effectively non-interacting. Additionally,  the LJ epsilon for both 
	atoms is set to 0. In the input file, bead_perturb_probability is set to 1.0,
	so that the only trial moves proposed are rearrangements of the	beads relative
	to each other. The centers of mass for the atoms do not change. 
	
	Example command sequence:
		mpmcxx -P 8 equilibrate.in > equilibrate.log
		mpmcxx -P 8 -xyz frames.xyz input.in > sim.log



sample-input/pi001-argon-dimer-2K/

	An argon dimer at 2K--potential is LJ only.

	Example command sequence:
		mpmcxx -P 8 equilibrate.in > equilibrate.log
		mpmcxx -P 8 -xyz frames.xyz input.in > sim.log
