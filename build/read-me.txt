============================
 GENERAL BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
============================

1. Install CMake version 3.9 or later.
2. Initialize the build environment using the CMake command:
	cmake ..
3. Then, builds can be performed normally using the make command:
	make


============
 MPI BUILDS
============

To build binaries for MPI parallel runs, substitute the command in step 2 with:
	cmake .. -DMPI=on


============
 OpenMP
============	

OpenMP support is included by default, and if the OpenMP package is not found
on your system, then it is not compiled into the executable. However, if OpenMP
is found for your compiler, but you wish to exclude the OpenMP libraries, add 
option -DOMP=off

E.g., to include MPI but exclude OpenMP issue the command:
	cmake ..  -DOMP=off -DMPI=on
